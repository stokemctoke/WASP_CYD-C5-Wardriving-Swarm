# W.A.S.P. — Wardriving Autonomous Swarm Platform

![W.A.S.P. — Wardriving Autonomous Swarm Platform](WASP_Repo-Image.jpg)

A from-scratch wardriving mesh built to learn how all the pieces fit together.

**W.A.S.P.** uses a **Nest / Worker** architecture:

- **Nest** (Cheap Yellow Display) — the base station. Purely UI, control, and connectivity. No wardriving. Manages worker status, handles file aggregation, and uploads to WiGLE and WDGWars when connected to a home network. Yellow. **All rich display work lives here.**
- **Worker** (Seeed XIAO ESP32-C5) — the autonomous scanner. Dual-band 2.4 GHz + 5 GHz WiFi and BLE. Carries its own GPS and SD card so it operates fully independently. Syncs back to the nest when in range. Black. **Status indicated by a single addressable RGB LED** — keeps power draw minimal for extended battery runs.

> Nest = yellow. Workers = black. Casings to follow.

---

## Worker vs Drone

Both run the same unified firmware. Mode is **auto-detected at boot** — no recompile needed.

| | Worker | Drone |
|---|---|---|
| SD card | Present | Absent |
| GPS | Present (used if detected) | Absent |
| Scan storage | WiGLE CSV on SD | 25-slot RAM circular buffer |
| Buffer capacity | Unbounded (SD) | 25 cycles × 40 WiFi + 20 BLE entries (~55 KB) |
| Buffer full behaviour | n/a | Oldest slot overwritten |
| Sync to nest | Raw TCP stream of `.csv` files (port 8080) | HTTP POST of serialised buffer slots |
| Coordinates | Real GPS fix (or NO FIX row) | 0.000000, 0.000000 |
| ESP-NOW heartbeat | Yes — `nodeType = 0x00` | Yes — `nodeType = 0x01` |
| Nest display label | Green dot · **W** | Cyan dot · **D** |

Detection order at boot:
1. `SD.begin()` — if it succeeds, Worker mode. If it fails, Drone mode.
2. GPS UART fed for 2 s — if `charsProcessed > 0`, GPS is live and used.

Both modes send an ESP-NOW heartbeat every 5 s and sync scan data to the nest every 25 cycles (configurable via `syncEvery` in `worker.cfg`).

---

## Why this split?

The CYD's standard ESP32 is 2.4 GHz only — adding wardriving there would introduce a second-class scanner into the data. More importantly, one radio cannot cleanly handle ESP-NOW (listening for workers) + channel-hopping (wardriving) + WiFi STA (home network uploads) simultaneously. Keeping the nest off scanning duty eliminates that radio contention entirely and keeps the UI fully responsive.

The result is a clean separation:

```
WORKERS  — scan everything, log locally, push to nest
NEST     — display, control, receive, upload
```

Want more coverage? Add another worker. The nest never changes.

## Hardware

| Role | Board | Colour | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nest | CYD JC2432W328C | Yellow | Built-in ILI9341 display, SD slot, touch |
| Worker | Seeed XIAO ESP32-C5 | Black | Dual-band (2.4 + 5 GHz) + BLE, RISC-V |

**All worker testing was done on the Seeed Studio XIAO Expansion Board v1.2** — the official carrier board for XIAO modules that provides a built-in OLED, SD card slot, Grove connectors, and clean breakouts for all XIAO pins without needing perfboard or loose wiring. This is the pre-perfboard stage of the build. If you are replicating this project, the XIAO Expansion Board removes a whole class of wiring problems and is strongly recommended for getting started.

The XIAO Expansion Board v1.2 exposes the following connections used by W.A.S.P.:

| Function | Expansion Board | XIAO pin | GPIO |
|---|---|---|---|
| GPS TX (module → C5) | GPS header | D7 | GPIO12 |
| GPS RX (C5 → module) | GPS header | D6 | GPIO11 |
| SD CS | SD header | D2 | GPIO25 |
| SD SCK | SD header | D8 | GPIO8 |
| SD MISO | SD header | D9 | GPIO9 |
| SD MOSI | SD header | D10 | GPIO10 |
| RGB LED data / R | D0 breakout | D0 | GPIO3 |
| RGB LED G | D4 breakout | D4 | GPIO23 |
| RGB LED B | D5 breakout | D5 | GPIO24 |

> **Note on the RGB LED:** Two types are supported, chosen via `ledType` in `worker.cfg`:
> - **`ws2812`** (default) — addressable WS2812B or SK6812 on D0 (GPIO3). SK6812 mini-e is recommended (3.3V tolerant). WS2812B works but prefers 5V logic — at short cable runs the C5's 3.3V output usually drives it.
> - **`rgb4pin`** — standard 4-pin common-cathode RGB LED. R=D0 (GPIO3), G=D4 (GPIO23), B=D5 (GPIO24). Pull each channel through a ~47–100Ω resistor to the GPIO pin; cathode to GND. D4 and D5 were freed when the OLED was removed.
> Pull the LED's power from the 3V3 pin for battery efficiency.

**Peripherals per worker:**
- RGB LED — status flashes (GPS state, scan active, sync result). Type (`ws2812` or `rgb4pin`), brightness, and on/off controlled per-worker via `worker.cfg`. Replaces SSD1306 OLED — the Nest display handles all rich status; an OLED on a field unit nobody can read wastes power.
- UART GPS module — independent geo-tagging
- SPI micro-SD module — local log storage when out of nest range

**Nest peripherals:**
- SD card (built-in CYD slot) — aggregated log storage
- Onboard RGB LED (active LOW) — status flashes. Red: GPIO 4, Green: GPIO 16, Blue: GPIO 17. GPIO 4 is shared with `TFT_RST` in `User_Setup.h`; safe to use as an output after `tft.init()` completes.

> **Display driver:** The JC2432W328C runs an **ILI9341** panel — confirmed by working firmware. Some sources list ST7789; that applies to a different CYD variant. Configure `TFT_eSPI`'s `User_Setup.h` with `#define ILI9341_DRIVER`.

> **Touch driver:** The JC2432W328C uses a **CST820 capacitive** controller on I²C (SDA=33, SCL=32, RST=25, addr=0x15) — *not* the resistive XPT2046/SPI controller used by older CYDs. The firmware drives it with a minimal `Wire`-based driver (`nest_touch.cpp`) — no extra library install. The CST820 INT pin (GPIO 21) collides with the TFT backlight on this board, so touch is polled, not interrupt-driven.

## LED Status Flash Codes

### Worker (D0/GPIO3 for WS2812B; D0+D4+D5 for 4-pin common-cathode)

| State | Colour | Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Boot / power-on | White | 3× quick flash (50 ms each) |
| GPS acquiring | Amber `#FAA307` | Slow pulse — 800 ms on / 800 ms off |
| GPS fix acquired | Cyan `#00FFFF` | 2× flash |
| Scan cycle start | Yellow `#FFFF00` | 1× flash (100 ms) |
| Connecting to Nest AP | Blue `#4488FF` | Fast blink (200 ms) |
| Sync success | Green `#00FF00` | 2× flash |
| Sync fail / nest unreachable | Red `#FF0000` | 3× fast flash |
| Chunked upload failed (file → .defer) | Orange `#FF6600` | 4× fast flash |
| Low heap warning | Red `#FF0000` | 1× slow pulse (400 ms) |

LED type, brightness, and all flash patterns are set per-worker in `/worker.cfg` on the worker SD card. See `worker.cfg.example`.

### Nest (onboard RGB LED — active LOW, GPIOs 4 / 16 / 17)

| State | Colour | Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Boot / power-on | White (R+G+B) | 3× quick flash (50 ms each) |
| Worker heartbeat received | Green | 1× brief flash (50 ms) |
| File chunk / sync received | Blue | 1× flash (80 ms) per chunk |

> GPIO 4 (red channel) is shared with `TFT_RST` in `TFT_eSPI`'s `User_Setup.h`. It is reclaimed as a plain output immediately after `tft.init()` completes — the reset pulse only fires once at startup.

## Getting Started

### Arduino IDE Setup

**Board package:** `esp32 by Espressif Systems` v3.0.0 or newer.
Install via `Tools > Board > Board Manager`.

| Device | Board selection |
|---|---|
| Nest (CYD) | `ESP32 Dev Module` |
| Worker (C5) | `XIAO_ESP32C5` |

> **Important for Worker — three settings required before flashing:**
> - `Tools > USB CDC On Boot > Enabled` — the C5 uses native USB, without this Serial output will not appear
> - `Tools > Partition Scheme > Huge APP (3MB No OTA/1MB SPIFFS)` — the default partition scheme only allocates ~1.25MB for the app; NimBLE needs ~1.35MB, so this is required (4MB flash is fine)
> - `Tools > PSRAM > Disabled` — the XIAO ESP32-C5 has no physical PSRAM; enabling it causes a boot crash (`Failed to allocate dummy cacheline for PSRAM memory barrier!`)

### Required Libraries

| Library | Install via |
|---|---|
| NimBLE-Arduino by h2zero | Tools > Manage Libraries |
| TinyGPS++ by Mikal Hart | Tools > Manage Libraries |
| Adafruit NeoPixel by Adafruit | Tools > Manage Libraries |
| TFT_eSPI by Bodmer | Tools > Manage Libraries |

> **TFT_eSPI requires manual configuration** — after installing, edit `Arduino/libraries/TFT_eSPI/User_Setup.h`. Comment out the existing driver and pin definitions, then add:
> ```cpp
> #define ILI9341_DRIVER
> #define TFT_MISO  12
> #define TFT_MOSI  13
> #define TFT_SCLK  14
> #define TFT_CS    15
> #define TFT_DC     2
> #define TFT_RST    4
> #define LOAD_GLCD
> #define LOAD_FONT2
> #define LOAD_FONT4
> #define SPI_FREQUENCY       40000000
> #define SPI_READ_FREQUENCY  20000000
> ```

### Flashing

Flash `stage15/nest/nest.ino` to the CYD and `stage15/worker/worker.ino` to the C5.

### Config Files

Both devices use a simple `key=value` config file on their own SD card. Lines starting with `#` are comments; no spaces around `=`.

| `gpsTxPin` | `11` | UART1 TX GPIO (GPS RX ← here) |

Config is read once at boot. If the file is absent, compiled-in defaults apply.
Each worker can carry its own `worker.cfg` so units can be tuned independently without reflashing.
